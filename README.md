# SMS Spam Classifier  

An end-to-end **Machine Learning + Full-Stack** project that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.  

This project combines **machine learning, API deployment, and full-stack integration** â€” trained a model with Python, deployed it using Flask, connected via Node.js backend, and built a React frontend for real-time predictions.  

---

## Features  
- Trained on the **Kaggle SMS Spam Collection dataset**  
- Implemented **Naive Bayes classifier** for text classification  
- Preprocessing pipeline: text cleaning, tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization  
- **Flask API** serving ML predictions  
- **Node.js backend** as a relay between frontend and ML API  
- **React frontend** with dynamic UI (green for ham, red for spam)  
- Real-time prediction for any SMS input  

---

## Tech Stack  
**Machine Learning & API**  
- Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy  
- Flask (for ML model API)  

**Backend**  
- Node.js (server + API relay)  

**Frontend**  
- React.js (UI for SMS input and prediction results)  

**Dataset**  
- [Kaggle SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
